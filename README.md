I made a tv series sharing website using nodejs mongodb(mongodb atlas) and express in backend and javascript and bootstrap in the front end.
This website has CRUD operations and I have used restful routing
See config(1).js file for database configuration details
This website is deployed to Heroku, link: https://tvserieswebsite.herokuapp.com/
